<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.11.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/milestone/15"><strong>36
resolved issues</strong></a> from <a href="#contributors"><strong>11 distinct contributors</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This is a release of the <strong>libraries</strong>, which are at version
0.11.0.  The <strong>API specification</strong> is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.</p>

<p>The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/apache-arrow-adbc-0.11.0/CHANGELOG.md">complete changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<p>This release includes <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=apache.arrow.adbc">NuGet packages</a> for C#.</p>

<p>The Flight SQL driver supports the session options and reuse-connection URI
scheme recently added to the protocol.</p>

<p>Go packages now require Go 1.21 or later, as Go 1.20 is out of support.  The
Go drivers now use a common driver framework to make future maintenance
easier.</p>

<p>Python wheels now include debug info to help investigate bug reports.  Also,
users of the DBAPI layer will find that the driver properly reacts to
SIGINT/Control+C in more places.</p>

<p>The Snowflake driver now returns table constraints metadata.</p>

<p>The SQLite driver now supports temporary tables and more ingestion options.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Apache Arrow PMC is pleased to announce the donation of the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-comet">Comet project</a>,
a native Spark SQL Accelerator built on <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion">Apache Arrow DataFusion</a>.</p>

<p>Comet is an Apache Spark plugin that uses Apache Arrow DataFusion to
accelerate Spark workloads. It is designed as a drop-in
replacement for Spark’s JVM based SQL execution engine and offers significant
performance improvements for some workloads as shown below.</p>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/arrow-site/img/datafusion-comet/comet-architecture.png" width="100%" class="img-responsive" alt="Fig 1: Adaptive Arrow schema architecture overview." />
  <figcaption>
   <b>Figure 1</b>: With Comet, users interact with the same Spark ecosystem, tools
    and APIs such as Spark SQL. Queries still run through Spark's query optimizer and planner. 
    However, the execution is delegated to Comet,
    which is significantly faster and more resource efficient than a JVM based
    implementation.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Comet is one of a growing class of projects that aim to accelerate Spark using
native columnar engines such as the proprietary <a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/photon">Databricks Photon Engine</a> and
open source projects <a href="https://incubator.apache.org/projects/gluten.html">Gluten</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids">Spark RAPIDS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kwai/blaze">Blaze</a> (also built using
DataFusion).</p>

<p>Comet was originally implemented at Apple and the engineers who worked on the
project are also significant contributors to Arrow and DataFusion. Bringing 
Comet into the Apache Software Foundation will accelerate its development and 
grow its community of contributors and users.</p>

<h1 id="get-involved">Get Involved</h1>
<p>Comet is still in the early stages of development and we would love to have you
join us and help shape the project. We are working on an initial release, and 
expect to post another update with more details at that time.</p>

<p>Before then, here are some ways to get involved:</p>

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.10.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/milestone/14"><strong>31
resolved issues</strong></a> from <a href="#contributors"><strong>18 distinct contributors</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This is a release of the <strong>libraries</strong>, which are at version
0.10.0.  The <strong>API specification</strong> is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.</p>

<p>The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/apache-arrow-adbc-0.10.0/CHANGELOG.md">complete changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<p>The BigQuery driver now handles large result sets, and supports passing a
scope when authenticating.  It also has better support for ARRAY types.</p>

<p>The C++ implementation now requires C++17 or later.</p>

<p>The Flight SQL driver now supports the incremental execution feature with
Flight SQL services that implement PollFlightInfo.  Also, it will reuse
credentials/cookies when creating sub-clients to fetch data.</p>

<p>The Go libraries now expose a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Close</code> method on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdbcDatabase</code> structs; this
is a potentially breaking change.</p>

<p>The Java implementation now has Checker Framework nullness annotations.  The
driver manager interface was overhauled; this is a breaking change to the
library APIs.  The Java Flight SQL driver now supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getObjects</code>.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL driver will add the PostgreSQL type name to the field metadata
of columns of NUMERIC type.  Also, it now handles ENUM types.</p>

<p>The Python bindings now return the underlying PyArrow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RecordBatchReader</code> when
requested, instead of the “wrapped” reader, due to a crash.  This means that
callers will not get ADBC-wrapped exceptions from the reader.  Also, Ctrl-C
will now interrupt ADBC operations on the main thread.</p>

<p>The Snowflake driver now has much, much faster bulk ingestion speed as it now
uploads bulk Parquet files instead of using bind parameters.</p>

<p>The primary focus of the nanoarrow 0.4.0 release was testing, stability, and code
quality. Notably, an implementation of the
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Integration.html#example-c-data-interface">C data interface integration test</a>
protocol was added to ensure data produced or consumed by nanoarrow can be
consumed or produced by other Arrow implementations.</p>

<p>Apache Arrow nanoarrow 0.4.0 also contains experimental <a href="#python-bindings">Python bindings</a>
to the C library for the purposes of community testing and feedback while a more stable
set of bindings is prepared (targeted for 0.5.0).</p>

<p>See the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/blob/apache-arrow-nanoarrow-0.4.0/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a>
for a detailed list of contributions to this release.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h2>

<p>Changes included in the nanoarrow 0.4.0 release will not break most downstream
code; however, several changes in the C library may result in additional compiler
warnings that could cause downstream build failures for projects with strict
compiler warning policies.</p>

<p>First, in debug mode (i.e., when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_DEBUG</code> is defined), an ignored return
value for functions that return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorCode</code> now issues a compiler warning
for compilers that support an “unused result” attribute. Ignoring the return value
of these functions is a common error and return values that are not
equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_OK</code> should be propagated as soon as possible. The C library
provides tools to check return values in a readable way. Notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_RETURN_NOT_OK()</code> can be used in a wrapper function that also returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorCode</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_THROW_NOT_OK()</code> can be used from C++ code that inclues <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nanoarrow.hpp</code>
and is prepared to handle exceptions.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_ASSERT_OK()</code> can be used to to check for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_OK</code> only in
debug mode (i.e., silently ignore errors in release mode and will crash in
debug mode with a message indicating the location of the error).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the first or second is preferred. The
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/main/getting-started/cpp.html#arrow-c-data-nanoarrow-interface-basics">Getting Started with nanoarrow in C/C++ tutorial</a>
includes examples and advice for handling errors emanating from the nanoarrow C
library.</p>

<p>Second, in debug mode (i.e., when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NANOARROW_DEBUG</code> is defined), the appropriate
attribute was added to check the format string passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorSet()</code>
against the provided arguments. Correct code will be unaffected by this change;
however, actual arguments that do not match the format string (e.g., an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int64_t</code>
that is passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowErrorSet()</code> with a format string of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"%d"</code>) should be
cast to the appropriate C type (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>) or the format string should be fixed
to support the type of the actual argument (e.g., using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"%" PRId64</code>).</p>

<p>Third, functions in the C library that do not take ownersip of or modify input
are now properly marked as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArrayViewGetIntUnsafe()</code>
previously accepted a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct ArrowArrayView*</code> and now accepts a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const struct ArrowArrayView*</code>. This change makes it more difficult to
accidentally modify input intended to be read-only and improves usability
from C++. Downstream projects that get a new warning about discarding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>
qualifier may need to adjust variable declarations or formal parameter types;
however, most projects should be unaffected by this change.</p>

<h3 id="cc">C/C++</h3>

<p>The nanoarrow 0.4.0 release includes a number of bugfixes and improvements
to the core C library and C++ helpers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An implementation of the
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Integration.html#example-c-data-interface">C data interface integration test</a>
was added, including a reader/writer for the Arrow integration testing JSON
format. This was used to improve test coverage of the IPC reader and to
add nanoarrow as a participating member of integration testing in the CI
job that runs in the main Arrow repository.</li>
  <li>The C library now supports a wider range of extended compiler warnings to
make it easier to vendor in projects with strict compiler warning policies.</li>
  <li>C++ helpers were improved to support const-correctness. As a result,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueSchema</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueArray</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueArrayView</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UniqueBuffer</code> now
work with a wider variety of C++ wrappers (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::unordered_map</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="r-bindings">R bindings</h3>

<p>The nanoarrow R bindings are distributed as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nanoarrow</code> package on
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>. The 0.4.0 release of the R bindings includes
improvements in type support and stability. Notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation was improved for low-level users of nanoarrow that are producing or
consuming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArray</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowSchema</code>, and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArrayStream</code> structures
from C or C++ code in other R packages.</li>
  <li>Improved conversion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list()</code>s to support more types when the <strong>arrow</strong> R
package is not available.</li>
  <li>Added more implmentations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as_nanoarrow_array_stream()</code> to support more object
types from the <strong>arrow</strong> R package.</li>
  <li>Added conversion from Arrow integer arrays to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">character()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python-bindings">Python bindings</h3>

<p>The nanoarrow 0.4.0 release is the first release that contains Python bindings to the
nanoarrow C library! These initial Python bindings are experiemntal and are provided
to solicit an initial round of feedback from the Arrow community. Like the nanoarrow
C library and R bindings, it provides tools to facilitate the use of the
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html">Arrow C Data</a>
and <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html">Arrow C Stream</a>
interfaces.</p>

<p>You can install the initial release of the Python bindings from PyPI. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nanoarrow</code>
Python package has been submitted to conda-forge and should be available once the
recipe has been reviewed.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install </span>nanoarrow

<p>The initial release of the Python bindings contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repr()</code>s to print out human-readable
representations of structures in the Arrow C Data and Stream interfaces.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">nanoarrow</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">na</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition to Arrow C Data interface wrappers, the initial nanoarrow Python bindings expose
wrappers for a few nanoarrow C library types like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrowArrayView</code> that can be used to
interpret the content of the raw structures.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">na</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">c_array_view</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">one</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">two</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">three</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">]))</span>

  - &lt;string data[11 b] b'onetwothree'&gt;
- dictionary: NULL

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, the initial bindings contain a user-facing “data type” class. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Schema</code>, like its
C Data interface counterpart, can represent a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.Schema</code>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.Field</code>, or a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyarrow.DataType</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">na</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">int32</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>The next release of nanoarrow for Python will include a user-facing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Array</code> class among other
improvements and features based on community feedback! For a more in-depth review of the

<h2 id="c-data-interface-notes">C Data Interface notes</h2>

<p>New format strings have been added for ListView, LargeListView, BinaryView and StringView array types.</p>

<h2 id="arrow-flight-rpc-notes">Arrow Flight RPC notes</h2>

<p>Flight SQL is now considered stable (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39037">GH-39037</a>). The Flight SQL specification was clarified regarding how the result set schema of a prepared statement is affected by bound parameters (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37061">GH-37061</a>).</p>

<p>The JDBC Arrow Flight SQL driver now supports mTLS authentication (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38460">GH-38460</a>) and bind parameters (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33475">GH-33475</a>), follows the Flight RPC spec when fetching data (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34532">GH-34532</a>), and can reuse credentials across metadata and data connections (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38576">GH-38576</a>). On macOS it will also use the system keychain to be consistent with other platforms (<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/39014">GH-39014</a>). Applications can also retrieve the underlying Flight RPC metadata from the JDBC driver (GH-38024, GH-38022).</p>

implementation, see the latest <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tags">Arrow Rust changelog</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>pmc</name></author><category term="release" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 15.0.0 release. This covers over 3 months of development work and includes 344 resolved issues on 536 distinct commits from 101 distinct contributors. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform. The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer you to the complete changelog. Community Since the 14.0.0 release, Curt Hagenlocher, Xuwei Fu, James Duong and Felipe Oliveira Carvalho have been invited to be committers. Jonathan Keane and Raúl Cumplido have joined the Project Management Committee (PMC). As per our tradition of rotating the PMC chair once a year Andy Grove was elected as the new PMC chair and VP. Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project! C Data Interface notes New format strings have been added for ListView, LargeListView, BinaryView and StringView array types. Arrow Flight RPC notes Flight SQL is now considered stable (GH-39037). The Flight SQL specification was clarified regarding how the result set schema of a prepared statement is affected by bound parameters (GH-37061). The JDBC Arrow Flight SQL driver now supports mTLS authentication (GH-38460) and bind parameters (GH-33475), follows the Flight RPC spec when fetching data (GH-34532), and can reuse credentials across metadata and data connections (GH-38576). On macOS it will also use the system keychain to be consistent with other platforms (GH-39014). Applications can also retrieve the underlying Flight RPC metadata from the JDBC driver (GH-38024, GH-38022). C++ notes For C++ notes refer to the full changelog.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>We recently <a href="https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/34.0.0">released DataFusion 34.0.0</a>. This blog highlights some of the major
improvements since we <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/06/24/datafusion-25.0.0/.">released DataFusion 26.0.0</a> (spoiler alert there are many)
and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months.</p>

<p><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/">Apache Arrow DataFusion</a> is an extensible query engine, written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, that
uses <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals">DataFusion’s primary design
goal</a> is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/">dataframe library</a> and
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html">command line SQL tool</a>.</p>

<p>This may also be our last update on the Apache Arrow Site. Future
updates will likely be on the DataFusion website as we are working to <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/discussions/6475">graduate
to a top level project</a> (Apache Arrow DataFusion → Apache DataFusion!) which
will help focus governance and project growth. Also exciting, our <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/discussions/8522">first
DataFusion in person meetup</a> is planned for March 2024.</p>

<p>DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a
community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as
individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">26.0.0</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">34.0.0</code>, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a
thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517
of them.
You can find a list of all changes in the detailed <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/datafusion/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>

<h1 id="new-features-">New Features ✨</h1>

<h2 id="dml--insert--creating-files">DML / Insert / Creating Files</h2>

<p>DataFusion now supports writing data in parallel, to individual or multiple
files, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parquet</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSV</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARROW</code> and user defined formats.
<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7655">Benchmark results</a> show improvements up to 5x in some cases.</p>

<p>Similarly to reading, data can now be written to any <a href="https://docs.rs/object_store/0.9.0/object_store/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ObjectStore</code></a>
implementation, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, local
files, and user defined implementations. While reading from <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/listing/struct.ListingTable.html#features">hive style
partitioned tables</a> has long been supported, it is now possible to write to such
tables as well.</p>

<p>For example, to write to a local file:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">❯</span> <span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">EXTERNAL</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">awesome_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">STORED</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">PARQUET</span> <span class="k">LOCATION</span> <span class="s1">'/tmp/my_awesome_table'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h1 id="datafusion-in-2024-">DataFusion in 2024 🥳</h1>

<p>Some major initiatives from contributors we know of this year are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Modularity</em>: Make DataFusion even more modular, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/8045">unifying
built in and user functions</a>, making it easier to customize 
DataFusion’s behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Community Growth</em>: Graduate to our own top level Apache project, and
subsequently add more committers and PMC members to keep pace with project
growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Use case white papers</em>: Write blog posts and videos explaining
how to use DataFusion for real-world use cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Testing</em>: Improve CI infrastructure and test coverage, more fuzz
testing, and better functional and performance regression testing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Planning Time</em>: Reduce the time taken to plan queries, both <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/7698">wide
tables of 1000s of columns</a>, and in <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/5637">general</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Aggregate Performance</em>: Improve the speed of <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/7000">aggregating “high cardinality”</a> data
when there are many (e.g. millions) of distinct groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Statistics</em>: <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/8227">Improved statistics handling</a> with an eye towards more
sophisticated expression analysis and cost models.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

the methods listed in our <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/contributor-guide/communication.html">Communication Doc</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>pmc</name></author><category term="release" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction We recently released DataFusion 34.0.0. This blog highlights some of the major improvements since we released DataFusion 26.0.0 (spoiler alert there are many) and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months. Apache Arrow DataFusion is an extensible query engine, written in Rust, that uses Apache Arrow as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries, machine learning and streaming applications. While DataFusion’s primary design goal is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a reasonable experience directly out of the box as a dataframe library and command line SQL tool. This may also be our last update on the Apache Arrow Site. Future updates will likely be on the DataFusion website as we are working to graduate to a top level project (Apache Arrow DataFusion → Apache DataFusion!) which will help focus governance and project growth. Also exciting, our first DataFusion in person meetup is planned for March 2024. DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between 26.0.0 and 34.0.0, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517 of them. You can find a list of all changes in the detailed CHANGELOG. Improved Performance 🚀 Performance is a key feature of DataFusion, DataFusion is more than 2x faster on ClickBench compared to version 25.0.0, as shown below: Figure 1: Performance improvement between 25.0.0 and 34.0.0 on ClickBench. Note that DataFusion 25.0.0, could not run several queries due to unsupported SQL (Q9, Q11, Q12, Q14) or memory requirements (Q33). Figure 2: Total query runtime for DataFusion 34.0.0 and DataFusion 25.0.0. Here are some specific enhancements we have made to improve performance: 2-3x better aggregation performance with many distinct groups Partially ordered grouping / streaming grouping Specialized operator for “TopK” ORDER BY LIMIT XXX Specialized operator for min(col) GROUP BY .. ORDER by min(col) LIMIT XXX Improved join performance Eliminate redundant sorting with sort order aware optimizers New Features ✨ DML / Insert / Creating Files DataFusion now supports writing data in parallel, to individual or multiple files, using Parquet, CSV, JSON, ARROW and user defined formats. Benchmark results show improvements up to 5x in some cases. Similarly to reading, data can now be written to any ObjectStore implementation, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, local files, and user defined implementations. While reading from hive style partitioned tables has long been supported, it is now possible to write to such tables as well. For example, to write to a local file: ❯ CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE awesome_table(x INT) STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '/tmp/my_awesome_table'; 0 rows in set. Query took 0.003 seconds. ❯ INSERT INTO awesome_table SELECT x * 10 FROM my_source_table; +-------+ | count | +-------+ | 3 | +-------+ 1 row in set. Query took 0.024 seconds. You can also write to files with the COPY, similarly to DuckDB’s COPY: ❯ COPY (SELECT x + 1 FROM my_source_table) TO '/tmp/output.json'; +-------+ | count | +-------+ | 3 | +-------+ 1 row in set. Query took 0.014 seconds. $ cat /tmp/output.json {"x":1} {"x":2} {"x":3} Improved STRUCT and ARRAY support DataFusion 34.0.0 has much improved STRUCT and ARRAY support, including a full range of struct functions and array functions. For example, you can now use [] syntax and array_length to access and inspect arrays: ❯ SELECT column1, column1[1] AS first_element, array_length(column1) AS len FROM my_table; +-----------+---------------+-----+ | column1 | first_element | len | +-----------+---------------+-----+ | [1, 2, 3] | 1 | 3 | | [2] | 2 | 1 | | [4, 5] | 4 | 2 | +-----------+---------------+-----+ ❯ SELECT column1, column1['c0'] FROM my_table; +------------------+----------------------+ | column1 | my_table.column1[c0] | +------------------+----------------------+ | {c0: foo, c1: 1} | foo | | {c0: bar, c1: 2} | bar | +------------------+----------------------+ 2 rows in set. Query took 0.002 seconds. Other Features Other notable features include: Support aggregating datasets that exceed memory size, with group by spill to disk All operators now track and limit their memory consumption, including Joins Building Systems is Easier with DataFusion 🛠️ Documentation It is easier than ever to get started using DataFusion with the new Library Users Guide as well as significantly improved the API documentation. User Defined Window and Table Functions In addition to DataFusion’s User Defined Scalar Functions, and User Defined Aggregate Functions, DataFusion now supports User Defined Window Functions and User Defined Table Functions. For example, the datafusion-cli implements a DuckDB style parquet_metadata function as a user defined table function (source code here): ❯ SELECT path_in_schema, row_group_id, row_group_num_rows, stats_min, stats_max, total_compressed_size FROM parquet_metadata('hits.parquet') WHERE path_in_schema = '"WatchID"' LIMIT 3; +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+ | path_in_schema | row_group_id | row_group_num_rows | stats_min | stats_max | total_compressed_size | +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+ | "WatchID" | 0 | 450560 | 4611687214012840539 | 9223369186199968220 | 3883759 | | "WatchID" | 1 | 612174 | 4611689135232456464 | 9223371478009085789 | 5176803 | | "WatchID" | 2 | 344064 | 4611692774829951781 | 9223363791697310021 | 3031680 | +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+ 3 rows in set. Query took 0.053 seconds. Growth of DataFusion 📈 DataFusion has been appearing more publically in the wild. For example New projects built using DataFusion such as lancedb, GlareDB, Arroyo, and optd. Public talks such as Apache Arrow Datafusion: Vectorized Execution Framework For Maximum Performance in CommunityOverCode Asia 2023 Blogs posts such as Apache Arrow, Arrow/DataFusion, AI-native Data Infra, Flight, DataFusion, Arrow, and Parquet: Using the FDAP Architecture to build InfluxDB 3.0, and A Guide to User-Defined Functions in Apache Arrow DataFusion We have also submitted a paper to SIGMOD 2024, one of the premiere database conferences, describing DataFusion in a technically formal style and making the case that it is possible to create a modular and extensive query engine without sacrificing performance.

<p>The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.9.0 release of
the Apache Arrow ADBC libraries. This covers includes <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/milestone/13"><strong>34
resolved issues</strong></a> from <a href="#contributors"><strong>16 distinct contributors</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This is a release of the <strong>libraries</strong>, which are at version
0.9.0.  The <strong>API specification</strong> is versioned separately and is
at version 1.1.0.</p>

<p>The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected
highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have
been made: we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/blob/apache-arrow-adbc-0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md">complete changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>

<p>The C#/.NET implementation is gearing up for a proper release and has had
various bugfixes in the core libraries, the drivers, and the ADO.NET wrapper.</p>

<p>The Go implementation now supports executing more methods (like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ConnectionCommit</code>) when importing a native C/C++ driver.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL driver can now write decimal values and dictionary-encoded
string/bytestring.  Also, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdbcConnectionGetTableSchema</code> was fixed to handle
the catalog and schema parameters correctly, and the driver now tries to
provide a row count for non-select queries.</p>

<p>The Python bindings now accept a PyArrow Dataset as a data source for bulk
ingestion.  The new <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html">PyCapsule interface</a> is supported.  It is
possible to build the Python packages via CMake, which simplifies handling the
mixed-C++-and-Python builds.</p>

<p>The R bindings reference-count objects to try to detect improper usage and
avoid crashes.</p>

<p>The Snowflake driver properly handles escaping and case sensitivity in various
metadata methods.  It also now supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StatementExecuteSchema</code>.</p>

<p>The Javadoc API reference is now included in the documentation.</p>
